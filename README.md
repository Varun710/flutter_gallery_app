### When Finished

When you have completed the assessment, email molly@ascentitech.com with the link to your new repository and answer the following questions as honestly as you can.

### Final Questions

1. How long did the assessment take to complete? Was there any task that took significantly longer than the others, and if so why?

It took around 7 hours to do. I spent around 2.5 hours going through a flutter tutorial as I haven't used it in a while. Then I spent around 1 hour learning about API and 2.5 hours coding. Then I spent around 1 hour debugging the code and trying to get the UI right. The main thing that took me a lot of time figuring out is the size of the container. I want the container height to be dynamic based on the image height. But I couldn't do it. Now its set to a constant height which is not ideal.

2. Were there any tasks that you initially did not know how to complete? And if so, how did you approach them and take the steps to learn how to complete them?
   (It's okay if the answer is yes! Everyone learns on the job at some point)

Yes. As I mentioned, its been a while since I used flutter. Lots of things have changed and I wanted to update my skills. First, I started with a flutter tutorial to learn the basics and then learnt a little about API calls. I also learnt about alighnment, fonts and color but didn't use them.

Resources used:

- Youtube
- Flutter docs
- Chat GPT
- Stackoverflow

3. Was this assessment feasible for the time given and relatively easy to follow? Any points of feedback?

Yes, the time was adequate. The assessment was really good and gave some areas where I need to improve and learn.

#### Bonus

If you have some extra time and would like to really impress, you should add a likes feature. This means adding a like icon button the the cards and favorites page that shows all the previously liked images!
